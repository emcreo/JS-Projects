JavaScript Projects

A collection of javascript work I've completed.

These files are meant as learning tools for me. Many are simple, some a little more complex. My hope to to have this repo, continue to grow as I improve my craft.

Here is a list of upcoming Javascript projects:

create text animation for examples on emcreo website

create a game for myself to play

create budget app for students
